| 18 oz (3 cups) | Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips                       |
|          14 oz | Condensed Milk                                   |

## Directions

Put **chocolate chips** in a microwave-safe bowl; pour **condensed milk** over (no need to stir).

Heat in microwave on high for **2** minutes.

Turn 8" square pan upside down; form aluminum foil over bottom and sides of pan; remove foil; flip pan over and fit into pan. *(This step makes it easier and the foil is less likely to tear.)*

Remove fudge mixture from microwave when done; stir until chips are melted and the mixture is smooth.

Stir in **vanilla** and **walnuts** *(optional)*.

Spread evenly into pan; chill until firm (at least **2** hours).

Remove foil and fudge from pan; peel off foil.

Cut fudge into small squares. Fudge will get firmer with time but will stay creamy.

Store in covered container at room temperature (or refrigerate).

Makes **2 lbs.** of fudge.
